Everything for Go's stdlib `log/slog` in one place: configure it from the environment, and stack handlers onto it that ship logs to Loki or keep them searchable in memory.

Spiritual successor to [`logrus-configurator`](https://github.com/psyb0t/logrus-configurator), and the continuation of `slog-configurator` — see [Migrating](#migrating-from-slog-configurator).

## Layout

```
slogconf/              configure slog from the environment
handlers/              Handler (the process's output) + FanOutHandler (tees to many)
handlers/logring/      bounded in-memory ring you can search
handlers/loki/         push records to Loki's HTTP API
```

Two kinds of thing live here, and the split is the whole design. `handlers` holds
the **structural** pieces — the one that writes your output, and the one that tees
a record to many. Its subpackages are **destinations**: a searchable ring, a Loki
server. You configure one output and add as many destinations as you like.

Runtime dependencies are `ctxerrors` and nothing else — no config loader, no HTTP framework. Every handler here talks to `log/slog` and the standard library.

## Quick Start

```bash
go get github.com/psyb0t/slogging
```

```go
package main

import (
	"log/slog"

	_ "github.com/psyb0t/slogging/slogconf" // configures slog at init time
)

func main() {
	slog.Info("this is an info message", "user", "psyb0t", "action", "testing")
	slog.Error("this is an error message", "error_code", "E001")
}
```

```bash
export LOG_LEVEL="debug"      # debug / info / warn / error
export LOG_FORMAT="json"      # json / text
export LOG_ADD_SOURCE="true"  # include source file/line/function
go run main.go
```

```json
{"time":"2026-08-08T20:34:53.296Z","level":"INFO","msg":"this is an info message","user":"psyb0t","action":"testing"}
```

**stdout/stderr are split automatically** — info and debug to stdout, warnings and errors to stderr. Container log collectors capture both and tag them, so error noise stays separate from happy-path noise.

## slogconf

The blank import does everything above. Reach for the API when you need more.

**Name the env vars yourself.** `LOG_LEVEL` and friends are the defaults, not the law:

```go
import "github.com/psyb0t/slogging/slogconf"

if err := slogconf.Init(slogconf.Options{
	LevelEnvVar:  "MYAPP_LOG_LEVEL",
	FormatEnvVar: "MYAPP_LOG_FORMAT",
}); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

Only the variables you name get read, so a stray `LOG_LEVEL` can't sneak in behind yours — `AddSourceEnvVar` renames the third one the same way. `DefaultLevel` / `DefaultFormat` / `DefaultAddSource` move the fallbacks. The zero `Options{}` is exactly what the blank import does.

**Call it early.** `slog.Logger.With` snapshots the handler chain when called, so a logger derived before `Init` keeps pointing at the old one.

**Adding a destination vs changing where you print.** These are different jobs and have different calls:

```go
slogconf.AddSink(ring)        // ALSO send records here — appends
slogconf.SetOutput(handler)   // send my output THERE instead — replaces, keeps sinks
slogconf.SetHandlers(h)       // start over: replaces the output AND every sink
```

The distinction is load-bearing, not cosmetic. `Init` installs an output handler that already writes to stdout and stderr. Adding a *second* handler that also writes to the terminal doesn't replace the first — both receive every record and print it twice. `SetOutput` is the call that swaps it, and it leaves anything you added with `AddSink` in place.

`SetHandlers` is the escape hatch, mostly for tests pointing everything at a buffer: it discards your sinks too.

Both `AddSink` and `SetOutput` return `false` when something else had already replaced slog's default — still applied, but the stdout/stderr split is gone, which is worth noticing rather than discovering through missing logs.

A handler that fails doesn't take the others down with it: every handler gets the record regardless, and failures come back joined. slog discards whatever `Handle` returns, so a fan-out that bailed on the first error would let an unreachable Loki silently kill stdout logging with nothing to say why.

## handlers

`Handler` is the process's output. Every record goes to one of two writer sets, chosen by level:

```go
import "github.com/psyb0t/slogging/handlers"

h, err := handlers.NewStd(handlers.Options{Format: handlers.FormatJSON})
slogconf.SetOutput(h)
```

Point both sets somewhere else, or at several writers each:

```go
h, err := handlers.New(
    handlers.Options{Format: handlers.FormatJSON},
    handlers.Stdout(os.Stdout, logFile),
    handlers.Stderr(os.Stderr),
)
```

Several writers on one side get the same bytes. Different *renderings* per destination is a different job — build a `Handler` each and tee them with `handlers.NewFanOut(...)`.

**Point both sides at the same writer and everything lands together**, which is what stdlib slog does — it puts every level on stderr. Splitting is the default here so a log collector can separate error noise from happy-path noise without parsing. `Options.SplitAt` moves the boundary (default `slog.LevelWarn`).

**`Options.Level` is the one setting that stays live.** It's a `slog.Leveler`, resolved on every record rather than read once, so a `*slog.LevelVar` you bump later actually takes effect:

```go
level := new(slog.LevelVar)
h, _ := handlers.NewStd(handlers.Options{Level: level})
slogconf.SetOutput(h)

level.Set(slog.LevelDebug)   // takes effect immediately
```

## handlers/logring

A bounded in-memory ring, so a process can answer "what just happened" without leaving the process.

```go
import (
	"github.com/psyb0t/slogging/handlers/logring"
	"github.com/psyb0t/slogging/slogconf"
)

ring := logring.New(logring.Options{})
slogconf.AddSink(ring) // the ring IS the slog.Handler

page := ring.Search(logring.SearchOptions{
	Attrs:    map[string]string{"request_id": "abc123"},
	MinLevel: slog.LevelWarn,
	Limit:    50,
})

fmt.Printf("showing %d of %d\n", len(page.Entries), page.Total)
```

`Search` returns the entries plus `Total` — the match count *before* `Limit` and `Offset`, counted in the same locked walk. Without it, a full page and the last page are indistinguishable.

**`Attrs` matches structured attributes captured off the record**, not a substring of the line — so it behaves the same in text or JSON mode, and finds attributes bound upstream via `logger.With(...)` that never appear on the record at all. Grouped attrs use dotted keys: `WithGroup("http")` logging `status` matches `http.status`.

Also filters on `Contains`, `Exclude`, `Match` (a compiled `*regexp.Regexp`), `Levels`, `Since`, `Until`, `Offset`, `Ascending`.

How full it is:

```go
bytes := ring.Size()            // what the ring bounds itself by
count := ring.Len()             // how many records that is
n, b, dropped := ring.Stats()   // all three under one lock
recent := ring.Tail(50)         // newest 50, oldest-first, unfiltered
```

Bounded **by bytes, not record count** (100 MiB default), so one pathological 100 KB line can't evict a hundred useful ones. `Size()` is the number to watch — it decides when older records start disappearing. Nonzero `dropped` means records were refused for exceeding the per-record cap, so a search is running over an incomplete picture.

**It's a debugging aid, not a log store** — per-process, bounded, and gone when the process dies. Ship logs somewhere durable too.

## handlers/loki

```go
import (
	"github.com/psyb0t/slogging/handlers/loki"
	"github.com/psyb0t/slogging/slogconf"
)

client, err := loki.NewClient() // reads SLOGGING_LOKI_URL
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

handler, err := loki.NewHandler( // reads SLOGGING_LOKI_APPNAME
	client,
	slog.LevelInfo,
	map[string]bool{"tenant": true}, // these attrs become Loki LABELS
)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

slogconf.AddSink(handler)
```

`NewClientWithConfig` / `NewHandlerWithConfig` take the same settings directly when you'd rather not use the environment.

**Choose `LabelKeys` carefully.** Loki indexes by label and every distinct value creates a new stream, so a high-cardinality key like `request_id` means one stream per request. Attributes not named there go into the log line instead. `app`, `level` and `service` are always labels.

**Pushes are best-effort and never block.** An unreachable Loki, a malformed payload, a 500 — all dropped with a `Debug` line. slog discards whatever `Handle` returns, so surfacing an error achieves nothing, and retrying would let a dead Loki stall the application that's only trying to log.

## Migrating From slog-configurator

This module was `github.com/psyb0t/slog-configurator` through v1.5.0. Those versions keep resolving under the old path, so nothing breaks until you move.

| before | after |
|---|---|
| `_ "github.com/psyb0t/slog-configurator"` | `_ "github.com/psyb0t/slogging/slogconf"` |
| `slogconfigurator.Init(...)` | `slogconf.Init(...)` |
| `github.com/psyb0t/slog-configurator/logring` | `github.com/psyb0t/slogging/handlers/logring` |
| `github.com/psyb0t/common-go/slogging/loki` | `github.com/psyb0t/slogging/handlers/loki` |

Every exported name was unchanged in that move — only import paths and the package name changed, so it was a find-and-replace on imports.

Since v1.7.0 the handler API changed as well:

| before | after |
|---|---|
| `slogconf.AddHandler(sink)` | `slogconf.AddSink(sink)` |
| — | `slogconf.SetOutput(h)` — swap where you print, keeping sinks |
| `slogconf.NewMultiWriterHandler(fmt, opts, out, err)` | `handlers.New(handlers.Options{…}, handlers.Stdout(out), handlers.Stderr(err))` |
| `slogconf.MultiWriterHandler` | `handlers.Handler` |
| `slogconf.FanOutHandler` / `NewFanOutHandler` | `handlers.FanOutHandler` / `handlers.NewFanOut` |

`MultiWriterHandler` never was one — it took exactly two writers and routed by level. `handlers.Handler` is that thing named for what it does, and `handlers.Stdout` / `handlers.Stderr` are variadic, so "several writers per stream" is finally what the API actually offers.

The Loki handler additionally drops its `gonfiguration` and `common-go` dependencies. `NewClient` and `NewHandler` read the same `SLOGGING_LOKI_URL` / `SLOGGING_LOKI_APPNAME` variables as before, just via the standard library.
